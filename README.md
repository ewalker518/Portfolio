# Portfolio

This is a website designed to showcase my work as an up-and-coming web developer, and also includes a bio, contact information, and a resume.

Navigation tool at the top allows for ease of access, links to different projects as well as links to contact information

### Temporary Placeholders

The bio will eventually be properly written
For now there is only one website I've worked on, others will be added to fill in those slots
My professional music resume is the one available for download, that will be replaced with a more relevant resume as soon as I can get it made
